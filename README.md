Are you struggling to come to terms with the fact that you might be hard of hearing? Need help to recall information and learn new things? Aging is an uneasy transition, as people find themselves restricted in their capacities. However, is aging always to blame? One team insists that measures can be implemented to ensure hearing and cognition are in check despite their age. Of course, this wouldn't apply to severe cases, but people starting to notice issues could reverse part of the symptoms if they act now. The same team mentioned previously claims to have developed a dietary supplement that might do the trick. Without any further delay, here's a comprehensive review of NeuroRise .

What is [NeuroRise](https://sites.google.com/view/neurorise-help-to-hearing/home)? 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NeuroRise](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/4b6fa276-3737-4a88-827b-7c799ba7055a/page/SDFPD) is an all-natural hearing support formula that helps maintain a healthy nervous system for proper ear function. In addition to hearing, the founder, Steve Brown, believes it has the potential to reduce inflammation, improve blood flow to the ears, demonstrate neuroprotective characteristics, assist memory, and reduce stress. Individuals should deduce from this intro that NeuroRise is a holistic supplement that targets several areas of health for full-body restoration. To get a feel for what permits NeuroRise to go beyond the scope of hearing and improving brain and cognitive functions, one must educate themselves on the foundation of this formula, which will be explored next.

**Hawthorn Berry (250mg)** 

Hawthorn is a thorny shrub in the rose family that produces little berries known as haws. Many of the health benefits of haws (or hawthorn berries) are due to their high antioxidant content. The latter property is supposed to help dilate blood vessels, enhance blood flow, and protect blood vessels. While research is limited on the direct effect of hawthorn berries on hearing, one source suggests that the berries' general ability to improve blood flow and circulation might imply a reduced risk of hearing loss.

**Epimedium (250mg)** 

Epimedium (aka horny goat weed) is a traditional Chinese medicine herb promoted for treating osteoporosis. Much of the evidence surrounding this herb's efficacy is considered anecdotal, yet it remains a popular ingested ingredient. Existing animal-based studies have demonstrated the herb's ability to improve blood flow to the brain and synaptic plasticity (the primary site within the brain where information is stored) while also ensuring blood vessel health in the brain.

**Damiana Leaf (200mg)** 

Damiana \[2 \] is a shrub whose leaves are used predominantly in traditional Mexican medicine. To name a fraction, it comprises several plant compounds like arbutin, pinocembrin, and Z-echinacea that support several health conditions. Some examples of health areas where an improvement may be noticed include anemia, bronchitis, cough, diabetes, fever, fungal infection, and pulmonary and respiratory diseases. 

Although this herb has not been examined in the context of the hearing, it is thought to alleviate stress, depression symptoms, and insomnia. It also has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, which may improve brain health. These conclusions, however, appear to be based on animal or cell studies.

**Muira Puama Root (200mg)** 

Muira puama is a bush that grows in the Amazon region. As one source \[3\] explained, its wood root is primarily used in herbal medicine. For NeuroRise, this ingredient's anxiogenic effects might be useful. In other words, individuals can anticipate increased mental performance and physical stamina. Moreover, some studies have demonstrated its ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme believed to suppress memory and cognition by breaking down the acetylcholine neurotransmitter. Before confirming this root's benefits, more research must still be conducted on human subjects.

**Ginkgo Biloba (120mg)** 

Ginkgo biloba \[4 \] is a Chinese tree whose leaves and seeds have long been utilized in traditional Chinese medicine. Regarding properties, ginkgo biloba is high in antioxidants, which are thought to counteract the harmful effects of free radicals. Furthermore, this ingredient may reduce inflammation, alleviating symptoms associated with arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and the risk of heart attack and stroke. Ginkgo's ability to increase blood flow may explain why it is suitable for brain function. Concerning brain function, some research suggests that this herb may improve mental performance (memory, focus, and attention span), lowering anxiety and alleviating depression. 

**Asian Ginseng Root (120mg)** 

Asian ginseng \[5 \] is a root native to China, Korea, and Siberia. It is highly promoted in herbal medicine for increasing the body's response to environmental stress and overall wellness. Some reported benefits of this ginseng variant include improved physical stamina, focus, and memory, stimulated immune function, slowed aging processes, and respiratory and cardiovascular disorders. Once again, research is scarce, so individuals should do their due diligence before proceeding. The latter especially holds with hearing, but theoretically, improved blood circulation and reduced inflammation in the ears might support hearing health. 

**Tribulus Fruit (120mg)** 

Tribulus fruit \[6 \] is used in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines to alleviate pain, stimulate the appetite, ease blood pressure, and boost libido levels. A possible reason why this ingredient is helpful for brain health has to do with its rich source of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Specifically, it might reduce stress and symptoms associated with depression and anxiety. It is important to note that these results are mainly derived from animal and cell-based studies. As for its impact on hearing, very little suggests such a relationship. 

**Catuaba Bark (84.5mg)** 

Catuaba bark is a natural herb obtained from Brazilian trees. It has been used for ages as an aphrodisiac or a central nervous system stimulant. The aforementioned implies improved brain and cognitive capabilities and general mood. There is also some evidence that Catuaba may alleviate symptoms of memory loss, but there have been few current research addressing this association. 

**Saw Palmetto (84.5mg)** 

Saw palmetto \[7 \] is a palm native to the southeastern United States. It has been predominantly used to improve prostate health, balance hormonal levels, and prevent hair loss in men. There is promising evidence surrounding saw palmetto's ability to decrease inflammation and improve antioxidant status. Unfortunately, the minimal evidence of gains in cognition or hearing makes its inclusion in NeuroRise quite confusing.

Final Thoughts 
---------------

Individuals should have concluded from the preceding analysis that NeuroRise is more than just a hearing supplement. Ingredients designed to relieve inflammation and increase blood circulation are at the heart of this formula. Increased inflammation in the body impacts our immune system, which may attack our inner ear uncontrolled. The latter could begin in one ear and spread to the other. Blood circulation is an equally vital component because it facilitates nutrient delivery and, thus, optimal ear functioning. This team appears to have targeted the brain because of its significance in interpreting electrical signals that go via the auditory nerve into sounds we recognize. 

In general, this team's approach to NeuroRise has merit. However, studies on the direct effect of some ingredients either do not show that they improve hearing or have yet to be studied extensively to reach such a conclusion. A few have promising evidence that they may improve circulation, regulate inflammation, and target brain function, all of which may promote improved hearing indirectly. Therefore, individuals must consider the disparity between traditional and scientific procedures. Given the lack of convincing evidence, one's next steps should include conducting a comprehensive inquiry into the ingredients (while keeping one's health in mind) before placing an order. **[To find out more about NeuroRise, visit the official website today!](https://www.glitco.com/get-neurorise)**
